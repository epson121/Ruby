## Ruby scripts/snippets/programs

This is my ***Ruby*** repository [test branch]. In here I place all my ruby code made while learning some new concepts (various tutorials), reading books or making programs/scripts that are too small for their own repository.

This repo currently includes, more or less, the following things:

- stuff from SAAS class on Coursera (currently on edx, [saas page](https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeley/cs-169-1x/software-service/993)
- simple graph class
- /various ~=> more code that does not belong anywhere :)
- /wgr ~=> coded while following the "Well Grounded Rubyist" book
- /clrs ~=> algorithms from "Introduction to algorithms"


This repository is constantly being updated.
