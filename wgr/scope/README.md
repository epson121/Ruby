= Ruby problems

This is my personal repository for problems i solve in Ruby programming language

Some of them are from coursera class: "SaaS"

Others are from books I read (eg. wgr/ is from "Well grounded Rubyist" book), or some other sources I encounter.

Feel free to use this code.

If you have any questions, email me.

To generate documentation, use RDoc.
